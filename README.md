# Movie Marathon Generator

## Notice:
The Netflix Roulette API used to make this app is no longer available, but feel free to take a look at the code used for this project. 

## Motivation:
I made this web site because I love movies and I love movie marathons and I know I can't be the only one. I also hate decisions and this aids in the process. This page is for everyone that loves movies and has ever just wanted to have a lazy day where you sit around and watch movies. I hope you have some fun with it!

## Contributions:
If anyone knows of another movie API that allows you to search by actor/actress I would be open to the implementation of a new API
